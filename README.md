# ActiveRecord Associations Review

ActiveRecord associations are an iconic Rails feature. They allow developers to
work with complex networks of related models without having to write a single
line of SQL--as long as all of the names line up!

## Objectives

After this lesson, you will be able to...

1. Create the correct foreign keys for associations.
2. Use the correct association macros to apply an ActiveRecord association.
3. List the methods that are added by the association macros.
4. Use `build` and `create` correctly to instantiate associated data.
   `post.build_author` and `author.posts.build`
5. Add associated data to a collection assoction (push objects onto a `has_many`
   association, `@category.posts << post`).
6. Identify the SQL generated by various association methods.
7. Construct a join model and table.
8. Use a `has_many :through` with a join model.
9. Manipulate associated data from a `has_many :through` including creating the
   association from the join model directly `PostTag.new(:post => post, :tag =>
   tag)`

# Foreign Keys

It all starts in the database. **Foreign keys** are columns that refer to the
primary key of another table. Conventionally, foreign keys in ActiveRecord are
comprised of the name of the model you're referencing, and `_id`.

Like any other column, foreign keys are accessible through instance methods of
the same name. For example, a migration that looks like this:

```ruby
class AddAuthorIdToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    change_table :posts do |t|
      t.integer :author_id
    end
  end
end
```

Would mean you could find a post's author with the following ActiveRecord query:

```ruby
Author.find(@post.author_id)
```

And you could lookup an author's posts like this:

```ruby
Post.where("author_id = ?", @author.id)
```

That's all great, but Rails is always looking for ways to save us keystrokes. By
using ActiveRecord's macro-style association class methods, we can add some
convenient instance methods to our models.

Here are the `Post` and `Author` classes with their associations defined:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
end

class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
end
```



## Notes

The rails Guide and the Association documentation can be used heavily here.

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html

We can use Post belongs to author and author has many posts for the
has_many/belongs_to, and then we can use post has many tags through posttag for
the has many through


this should be entirely in regards to AR and can move pretty fast / provide
summary as they technically already covered this material.

foreign keys - start with covering the required fks.  show the macros, has_many,
belongs_to, discuss that the macros are convention oriented, remind them of how
to figure out what option to pass.

talk about the macros simply adding methods, let's star twith the belongs to. I
think the belongs_to documentation can almost be used verbatim.
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-belongs_to

same thing with has_many, define it in the context of understanding the behavoir
that is being added to the model.

http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_many

has_many, through talk about how to figure out when to use a has many through
and the convetions for the join table, the fk columns, and how to correctly
create the associations.

remind them that once you have a has many through you have access to all the
same methods as a has many

talk about the SQL implications for has_many through - how many rows get
created, etc.
